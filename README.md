Liver diseases—such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver cancer—are major contributors to global health burdens. Early detection is crucial for improving outcomes and reducing mortality. This project uses **machine learning (Random Forest)** to predict liver diseases based on key medical parameters, offering a reliable, data-driven support tool for healthcare professionals.

## 🩺 Problem Statement

Liver disease often progresses silently, resulting in diagnoses at advanced stages where treatment is less effective. Early prediction enables timely interventions and better prognosis.

This project builds a machine learning model to assess the risk of liver disease using indicators such as:

- Liver function test results  
- Blood pressure  
- Medical history  
- Age and gender
